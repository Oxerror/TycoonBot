# TycoonBot

This is a hobby project of mine.

I want to learn about deep learning and really like the "Tycoon" game from Persona. 

The goal of this project is, that
- **First** it will recognize the current cards in your hand as well as in play
- **Second** it will analyze which cards are still in play and who has how many cards
- **Third** it will recommend me the best possible plays to win the game
